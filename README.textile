h1. madfiber.net

h2. hacking

To hack on madfiber.net, you should use `rvm` to install:

* ruby 1.9.1
* the bundler gem

Once those two things are installed, ask brad@bendyworks.com for access and do:

* git clone git@heroku.com:madfiber.net
* cd madfiber
* fix your database.yml file to your liking
  * heroku uses postgres, so that's what I'm using... ideally, it shouldn't matter which db you use locally
* bundle install

This project uses rails 3.0.0.beta1. That means the script/ folder is basically gone. Use the rails command for almost everything.

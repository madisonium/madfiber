  %strong just one city
  in the United States, and Madison fits their stated criteria. The Google Fiber trial network would offer Internet speeds of 1 gigabit per second (1,000 megabit per second) &mdash; or more than 100 times faster than what most Americans have today at a competitive price.

%p
  We believe Madison is a perfect fit as Google's trial city. Madison has a strong research and technology base, augmented by the 40,000 strong University of Wisconsin student population (10,000 new hungry minds a year) Madison hosts a growing high-tech entrepreneurial sector employing the demographics that will immediately adopt this service. Finally, Madison's city government is strongly and officially supporting this effort.

  than what most Americans have today" at "a competitive price." Google intends to test this ultra-high speed Internet in a city with a population between 50,000 and 500,000.
%p
  With a population of just under 225,000, we believe Madison is a perfect fit as Google's trial city. Madison has a strong research and technology base, augmented by the 40,000 strong University of Wisconsin student population. Madison is also home to a growing high-tech entrepreneur community and is home to many young professionals, who, along with college students, make up a large percentage of the demographic that loves to consume large amounts of bandwidth. Madison's city government is also a strong supporter of helping bring Google Fiber to Madison.
